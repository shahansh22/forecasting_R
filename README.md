# forecasting
  This repository contains implementations of key time-series forecasting techniques in R, including Simple Moving Average (SMA), Single Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt’s Linear Method, and Holt-Winters Method. Later weeks also cover text analytics and deriving insights from word clouds and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
